# Travogram Travel Itinerary Planner

This project is a cloud-based travel itinerary planner designed to help users create and manage their trips dynamically. It integrates with the Google Maps API to fetch place information based on GPS coordinates and leverages Azure Cloud services for backend functionality and data storage.

## Key Features
- Retrieve real-time location details from Google Maps APIs.
- Create, update, and manage travel plans using REST APIs built with Azure Functions.
- Store user trip data securely in Azure SQL Database.
- Deploy backend services with Azure App Services.
- User authentication handled via Azure Active Directory B2C.
- Monitor performance and system health using Azure Monitor.

## Technologies Used
- Azure Functions
- Azure App Services
- Azure SQL Database
- Azure Active Directory B2C
- Azure Monitor
- Google Maps API
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD)

## How It Works
1. User provides GPS coordinates to search for travel destinations.
2. The system fetches nearby locations using Google Maps APIs.
3. Users can create, update, and save their custom itineraries.
4. Data is securely stored and authenticated using Azure services.

## Status
This project is currently under development as part of my cloud computing learning journey.
